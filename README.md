# Low Level Design (LLD) & Design Patterns – C++ and Java

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **Low Level Design (LLD) examples and Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, implemented and documented with a **Java-first mindset**.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:

* Strong understanding of **SOLID principles**
* Ability to design **clean, extensible systems**
* Practical application of **design patterns** commonly used in real-world backend systems

This repo focuses on **design clarity over heavy implementation**.

---

## What This Repository Contains

### 📐 Low Level Designs (LLD)

Real-world system designs broken down into:

* Classes & interfaces
* Responsibilities
* Relationships
* C++ and Java-style method signatures

### 🧩 Design Patterns

Well-known patterns with **practical use cases**:

* Strategy
* Composite
* Factory
* Observer
* Command
* Singleton (best practices)

Each pattern includes:

* Intent
* When to use
* C++ and Java-oriented structure

---

## Design Philosophy

All designs in this repository follow:

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Where applicable, designs also highlight:

* Dependency Injection
* Loose coupling
* High cohesion

## How to Use This Repository

* 📖 For **interview preparation** (LLD & system design rounds)
* 🧠 To understand **how to break down real-world problems**
* 🧪 As a reference for **clean Java design**
* 📂 To showcase **design thinking on GitHub**

---

## Notes

* Most examples focus on **design and structure**, not full production code.
* Implementation can be extended easily once the design is approved.
* Diagrams are created using tools like **Excalidraw**.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add more real-world LLD problems
* Add undo/redo, versioning, concurrency considerations
* Convert selected designs into Spring Boot applications
